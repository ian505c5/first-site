					<h3>Project Overview</h3>
					<p>For our Intro to Strategy class, we explored the process of developing a strategy for targeting specific demographics for advertising. We started with choosing two target personas, and doing pyschographic research to get a sense of who these people are. Then we were given a brand, and tasked with identifying solid strategies for creative that would be effective at reaching our target demographics. The final step was to concept advertising executions that fell within our strategies.</p>

					<p><h3>The Personas</h3></p><br>
					<h5>Gus Fring</h5>
					<p>Gus is your sensible type. Keen on logic, Gus seeks value rather than flash. He has an eye for quality, and a sophisticated sense of style.</p><br>
					<h5>Hank Schrader</h5>
					<p>Hank is your typical man's man. He doesn't mind spending the money for the best product, and isn't shy about showing it off. You can typically find him with on Sunday with a beer in hand, watching football with buddies.</p>

					<h3>The Strategies</h3><br>
					<h5>Gus Fring</h5><br>
					<p>"Sony televisions are an uncomprimising value."</p><br>
					<p>Gus will always be tempted by the value brands. They offer similar features, at lower costs. However, while the features are similar, they are inferior, lacking, or even dated when compared to Sony. As a result, buyers of value brands find themselves upgrading sooner rather than later. This strategy aims to educate consumers, like Gus, that value doesn't mean cheap.<p>
					<br>
					<h5>Hank Schrader</h5><br>
					<p>"Sony televisions are unparalled in visual quality."</p><br>
					<p>Hank wants the best and he's willing to pay for it. Sony is on his list of brands, but he has trouble differentiating it from its competitors. He wants the brand that his friends wished they own. This strategy aims to position Sony as the industry leader, the brand of envy, in consumers', like Hank, minds.<p>

					<h3>The Executions</h3><br>
					<h5>Gus Fring</h5>
					<p>With Gus, the executions were focused on selling the fact that value brands can't stand up to Sony quality. Having been frugal his whole life, he may have underestimated how great the divide in quality can be. The ads reflect on this, and highlight that there is value and sensibility in settling for nothing less than the TV viewing experience you want and deserve, a Sony.</p><br>
					<h5>Hank Schrader</h5>
					<p>The executions for Hank focused on selling the Sony brand as objects of desire due their stunning visual quality. The ads portray the visual experience as being indistiguishable to you're own two eyes. Being that the televisions are such a cinemetic marvel, the Sony name is coveted by all, both human and beast.</p>
