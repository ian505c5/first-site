					<h3>Project Overview</h3>
					<p>One of the concepts covered in User Experience was the use of task flow charts to help streamline a user's experience as they attempt to complete a process. By mapping out the steps the user must take to completion, you can eliminate redunancies and identify dead ends. We were tasked with identifying a multi-step task users undertake on a website, and creating a chart to document the process.</p>

					<p><h3>Overview</h3></p>
					<p>The task I chose to document was placing an order for delivery through <a href="www.grubhub.com">GrubHub.com</a>. GrubHub is a US web and mobile company that lets users find delivery and takeout restaurants near them and order online for free. Users can either use the service as a guest, or sign up for an account which provides them with additional features such as one-click ordering and order histories.</p><br>
					<p>Overall the process was straightforward and efficient. Instructions were clear at every step, content was filtered appropriatly, and navigation between different stages was smooth. The only recomendations I could offer pertained to orders made by groups, rather than individuals. An option to split the final bill and tip evenly through multiple payments would be a great convenience for large parties, but its exclusion by no means detracts from the experience.</p>

					<p><h3>Our Thinking</h3></p>
					<p>Consumers engage with products that relate to them on some level. It could be the design of the shirt, the brand ideology, or that the item embodies some expression of their personality. Knowing this, what if the user had a say in what items the retailer made avaialble for sale? We think that if we empower the users to drive the style of our brand, in a fun and engaging context, consumers will ultimately want to own products of their own creation.</p>
				</div> -->
<!-- 				<div class="projtext tbl" id="solution">
					<p><h3>The Solution</h3><p>
					<p>Viktori Clothing is part retailer, part design community, and part Las Vegas. Each week, a competition is held between user submitted t-shirt designs. The designs with the most votes at the end of the week are sent to the printer. The remaining designs are discarded to either be resubmitted for the following competition or retouched. </p>
					<p>The voting plays out a little differently that one might be used to. Everytime you vote on a t-shirt, you pledge $15 on the design. If the design wins, you get the shirt for the $15 you already pledged (a hold is placed on your payment). If you lose, the $15 hold is lifted, and the money is returned to your account. This is the Vegas element, not every shirt you vote on will win, but when they do, its exciting and not only do you get a shirt on discount, but you helped make it happen.</p>
